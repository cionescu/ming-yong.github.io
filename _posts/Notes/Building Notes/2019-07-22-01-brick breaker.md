I want to be comfortable with JavaScript before moving on to React on freeCodeCamp. The only way I can think of is to build a bunch of small projects.

## Reference

- [YouTube video "Intro to Game Development with JavaScript - Full Tutorial" by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbleDe3_ZA8h3AO2rXar-q2V&index=6&t=0s)

## Result

![demonstration of brick breaker game]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/brickBreaker.gif)

The first small project I built is a brick breaker game. It is too complicated to rebuild without peeking the tutorial over and over again. I will need to break it down to smaller parts.
