I went to my very first meetup titled "Headless CMS, DevOps Tool and Scrum/Agile!". This is also the first time I heard about these topics so I decided to write down my current understanding of each.

### CMS

There are three types of CMS: traditional CMS, headless CMS and decoupled CMS.

In headless CMS, we took the control of front-end out from CMS, created a RESTful API for every devices to talk to, and put all the front-end code in our web server(back-end only). This is a solution to different screen sizes.

### DevOps and Agile

DevOps is a set of software development practices that bring software development team (Dev) and information-technology operations team(Ops) together to shorten the system development life cycle(delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives).

Agile software development is an approach/method to software development, it is about moving fast, releasing often, and reacting to the real needs of your users. Different ways(Software development frameworks) of dividing development work(SDLC, software development life cycle) are Scrum and Kanban.

DevOps practices can be done using the Agile approach.

### Scrum

In Scrum, the process of a production is called "sprint", it is a cycle of plan->do/build->check/review->action/change and usually takes 2 weeks(however company that executes daily sprint do exists). Scrum is conducted by a scrum master, who is normally the business analyst or the project manager.

Scrum/Agile practice brings in more conversation between developer team and business team compare to traditional waterfall method, however it also creates more issues than developer could fixes in some cases.
