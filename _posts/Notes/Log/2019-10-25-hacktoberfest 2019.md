Contribute to Open Source has always been something I would like to try, but it's scary, so I put it back to my to-do list.

"[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is a month-long celebration of open source software...", participants are challenged to submitted 4 pull requests by the end of October. It sounds doable, so I decided to give it a try.

### Contribution 1: My Favorite Resources

I started out with a baby contribution for [bhavaniravi/my-favorite-resources](https://github.com/bhavaniravi/my-favorite-resources) where I share two specific resources for learning Git/Github and working with data and APis in JavaScript.

### Contribution 2: womenintech-website

My second contribution is becoming a contributor for [womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website](https://github.com/womenintech-chennai/womenintech-website), I am learning React for this project. Both of these were found through a Twitter friend I met in CodeNewbie Twitter Chat.

### Contribution 3&4: open-pixel-art

I contributed one pixel to the [twilio-labs/open-pixel-art](https://github.com/twilio-labs/open-pixel-art) and translated the contribution guide into my language.

### What I learned

Although all my contributions are teeny-tiny and theoretically cheating if you ask me, I do learned something from this experience.

### It is not that scary

There is always closed issue and pull request that you can reference to, there is always documentation you can follow and you can always ask other contributors and the owner for further clarification!

### It is hard to find a project to contribute if you don't go find

I mean, you don't usually contribute to the first project you click in(or is that how it works?). Sometime you might found your skills doesn't fit the project and sometime you just don't know what to do with a project with empty README.

Browsing through GitHub and writing a better documentation are something I would like to keep practicing. I am very glad that I joined Hacktoberfest 2019. Hopefully in Hacktoberfest 2020, I can make some more meaningful contributions to the open source community.
