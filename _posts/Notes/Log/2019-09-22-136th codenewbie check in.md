I heard about CodeNewbie from a freeCodeCamp podcast on my way to school. The way that the founder, Saron, talks about how she designs her conferences really shows how much she cares about the community.

Today I had joined my first Coding Check-in Twitter chat, it was nice to learn about what others do and learn from what they do.

New things from this chat:

- [Drupal: a content management system.](https://twitter.com/leoraw/status/1175904215551684609)
- [A tutorial for learning react and firebase.](https://twitter.com/dev_nikema/status/1175839324346077184)
- [Someone I can ask about open source!](https://twitter.com/geeky_bhavani/status/1175837755143684096)

Before this, I do saw a lot of CodeNewbie hashtag on Twitter but I never give it a second thought. I am glad that freeCodeCamp brought me to this welcoming community and the community brought me to more new things.

We grow faster as one, and I hope I can be someone that helps you grow.
