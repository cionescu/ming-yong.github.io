I went to my first workshop: [UX/UI design workshop](https://github.com/ladieslearningcode/llc-ux) organized by Canadian Learning Code. It was well-organized and beginner-friendly, I do learned something about UI and UX and would like to share what this workshop is about.

### Takeaway

Be an empathy creator: understand the user's problems and create solution.

### A brief introduction to UX and UI

The workshop started out with an introduction to UX and UI.

What goes in to UX:

- strategy: competitor and product analysis, user personas, product structure, content writing.
- prototyping: wireframing, testing and iteration, planning, desktop and mobile.
- execution: working with UI design, tracking goals, development.

A typical process will goes like this: strategy->discovering->analysis->design->production

What goes in to UI:

- look and feel: customer analysis, design research, branding and graphic, user stories.
- responsiveness adn interactivity: hi-fidelity mockups, interaction animation, adapting to screen sizes, working with developers.

### Activity

This workshop focuses on the "design sprint" part of a participatory design cycle(which involves prep work, design sprint, building sprint, pilot and reflect).

Participants are divided into groups to came up with their own personas based on the topic. A personas is a user profile that represents your targeted user group, which includes information like factors that influence habits, needs, motivations and obstacles.

After a short presentation about our personas, we picked our top 3 problems to solve and started wireframing on paper and then created a low-fidelity prototype using a mobile app.

The last part of the workshop is to test our product, each members will take turns to be either a testee or a facilitator/note taker. We learned how to create test questions, how to not giving out too much guidance to our users, and what we can improve through user feedback.
