How cool is that!

Oh...okay maybe not. I'm very sorry for messing things up.

I have some suggestions on what you can do to find the post you're looking for:

- If you know you're looking for a blog, go to the [BLOG]({% link blog.html%}) page.
- If you know you're looking for a note, go to the [NOTES]({% link notes.html%}) page.
- If you don't know whether it's a blog or note, you can [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}) or [tweet]({{ site.social-links.twitter }}) me about your situation and I will try my best to help you.

Again, I'm very sorry for giving you a 404 instead of the post you want.ðŸ™‡ðŸ™‡ðŸ™‡
